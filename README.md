# *Vivace*, by Macrohard

## E-commerce Site Description
Macrohard Incorporated is a software company that has been in business since 2015. They employ close to 30 people to handle development and operations. Their focus had been to assist developers in creating software through their innovative developer tools; their flagship product being Material Workshop at the time. Unfortunately, Macrohard has fallen on hard times, and their software development products have been failing to meet sales goals for the last year. The company is desperate to acquire a new source of revenue.

Almost too conveniently for the company, President Jack Boxington, had an obsession with bad music. In fact, he was so obsessed, he also owned a small shop downtown that exclusively sold physical copies of bad music. He found moderate success; the store quickly became the CEO's primary source of income, thanks to the recent popularization of irony in today's youth. After months of watching his customers poke around on their phones, a solution to Macrohard's dilemma hit the man like a bullet train.

For Jack, it was a no-brainer: to save Macrohard, reform the company to sell bad music over the Web!

Macrohard is looking to potential web developers to create this website, dubbed Vivace. The website should present bad music first and foremost, with options for listening to and purchasing individual songs.
